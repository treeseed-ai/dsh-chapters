/**
 * The `chapters` agent preset row — our implementation of the host's own
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` declaration row, mounted from the bundle patch
 * (`cordis.patch.yml`, row id `preset-chapters`), so the preset is a visible Loader entry
 * exactly like `preset-standard` / `preset-ptc` rather than something a plugin does aside.
 *
 * WHY OUR ROW AND NOT THE HOST PACKAGE DIRECTLY
 * --------------------------------------------
 * A preset can be unusable in two ways and both are total: one unresolvable child row makes
 * the WHOLE preset `broken` (`mountPreset` throws on any failed row → `record.broken` →
 * `retain()` refuses with `agent-preset/invalid`), which is the same user-visible failure as
 * a missing preset — every chapters session stops composing while its durable log sits there
 * intact. Measured on the stable release with a composition copy-anchored to the alpha:
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-schedule` is not published at 0.2.0-rc.2 at all, and the boot said
 * `preset "chapters" is DECLARED BUT BROKEN — tool-schedule … never started`.
 *
 * So this row does what the host's does, plus drop-what-will-not-load. It also refuses to
 * brick a host predating the mechanism: a `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` row is
 * unresolvable before 0.1.7-alpha.1, and ONE unresolvable row aborts a legacy plugin tree
 * (`plugin tree failed to load: … Cannot find package`), while a row naming our own package
 * resolves wherever our package runs. The support floor is 0.2.0, so that is now
 * belt-and-braces rather than the reason — and it is why the row plugin is ours.
 *
 * WHAT IS COPIED FROM THE HOST'S PLUGIN, LINE FOR LINE
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *  - `static inject = ['agentPresets']` — the registry's shape, never a version test.
 *  - `static [EntryGroup.key] = true` — "preserve child expressions until their own plugins
 *    activate". Without it the Loader interpolates `!!js` against the HOST context, and
 *    `disabled: !!js process.platform === 'win32'` stops belonging to the child row that
 *    owns it.
 *  - `[Service.init]` `yield`s the registry's disposer, so Cordis owns the registration's
 *    lifetime. That also disposes of the trap the first draft fell into: calling
 *    `ctx.effect(disposer)` from `apply()` fires when the apply FIBER finishes, which
 *    un-registered the preset the instant it had been registered (measured on 0.2.0-rc.2:
 *    `register()` reported success while the roster came back without `chapters`).
 *
