# dsh-chapters

**Long memory for local AI: a [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)
plugin that archives agent conversations as verbatim chapters, continues sessions from a Table of
Contents at zero inference-token cost, and turns that archive into a shared, searchable knowledge
pool.** Published on npm as [`@treeseed/dsh-chapters`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@treeseed/dsh-chapters);
source at [treeseed-ai/dsh-chapters](https://github.com/treeseed-ai/dsh-chapters).

## Install (the whole setup)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @treeseed/dsh-chapters      # install into your harness profile
dsh plugin --profile web update @treeseed/dsh-chapters   # keep current — restart `dsh web` after
```

`--profile <name>` is required on every `dsh plugin` command (`web` = the browser harness profile).
After restart you have the fork button, six agent tools, four `/chapters-*` commands — and the
optional `chapters` preset that routes `/compact` through the zero-token engine.

## Developing / contributing

The site's Part VI covers the daily loop; the repository itself holds the engineering truth for agents:

- **[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)** — working spec for AI agents developing this repo (invariants, budget, hard rules)
- **[`docs/`](docs/)** — deep specs: `contract.md` (host API facts), `architecture.md` (mechanics), `development.md` (build/test loop + tape system), `verify.md` (every claim's procedure), `knowledge-repo.md` (design record), `host-compaction-seam.md`, `provider.md`
- **benchmarks**: `npm run bench` — three arms, local model, never CI ([protocol](benchmarks/README.md))
