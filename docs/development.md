# Development and Test Loop

The problem is real: **this repository is edited from inside a running DeepSeek Harness, and a plugin
only takes effect after that host restarts.** Restarting it would kill the session doing the work. So
the loop has to be built so that it never touches the host it runs in. Everything below was verified on
this machine, not assumed.

## Environment Facts (checked, not inferred)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Host serving this session | global npm install, `/usr/lib/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js`, **0.1.5-rc.1**, listening on `127.0.0.1:3080` |
| Profile root | `~/.dsh` (`DSH_HOME` default) — `profiles/`, `sessions/`, `storages/`, `.credentials.yaml` |
| Sandbox effect | `~/.dsh` is **read-only** from the agent sandbox: `dsh web --help` died with `EROFS: read-only file system, open '/home/adrian/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.yml'` |
| Dev fork | `~/Projects/deepseek-harness` — git `fb2c4b9e69` (2026-09-10), **0.1.5-rc.2**, pnpm workspace, `node_modules` installed |
| `/app/checkout` | **does not exist on this machine.** It appeared in my *session context* as a presumed harness checkout, not in this repository's docs — I checked, and no file here references it. The real fork is the row above |

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

1. **The sandbox is an ally, not an obstacle.** Because `~/.dsh` is read-only to an agent shell, the
   accidental self-destruct path — installing into the live profile and restarting the host running the
   work — is *structurally unavailable*. The dev loop is the only loop available.
2. **The fork is newer than the host** (rc.2 vs rc.1), and `examples/deepseek-harness` is a third
   snapshot. Line numbers in `docs/contract.md` come from the `examples/` copy. Treat any of the three as
   truth only for the question you asked it; resolve real behaviour against the version you are actually
   booting.

## The Isolation Mechanism: `DSH_HOME`

`dsh --help` documents profiles as "the profile under `$DSH_HOME/profiles` to boot", and `DSH_HOME`
relocates the entire root — profiles, sessions, storages, credentials. Verified:

```bash
mkdir -p .dshdev
DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev dsh web --port 0 --no-open
# → dsh web: http://127.0.0.1:32869/?token=…
```

A **fresh, fully isolated instance** booted: it created its own `profiles/web` under `.dshdev`, chose a
free port, minted its own token, and left `~/.dsh` and the `:3080` host untouched. `--port 0` means the OS
picks, so nothing conflicts. This is the whole answer: we get a disposable harness.

`.dshdev/` is gitignored. Never point `DSH_HOME` at `~/.dsh`, and never run `dsh plugin --profile web add`
without it — that is the command that mutates the profile this session is living in.

### The dev profile for the real target: `scripts/bootstrap-dev-profile.sh`

Everything so far measured on cloud models; the plugin's target is the user's **Local
qwen3.8-flash-next** at the **64K window the user actually runs** (32K was tried and
rejected as too small for real work — the 27-tool header alone is ~13–15K; the user
confirmed the model is configured for 64K). `dev/settings.yaml` +
`dev/profile-cordis.patch.yml` mirror the live `~/.dsh` Local-provider block exactly —
same model, window (64K, just under the server's real `n_ctx: 65536`), and timeouts — and
make **Chapters the default preset** and **Local the default model**, so nothing there is
"enabled by remembering". The r27 gold run proves the engine's pressure math at this exact
regime (threshold 57,600; a 93K-token session compacts before its first request).
Bootstrap is write-if-missing for your tuned settings; `--force` re-templates. Build + link +
settings + credential-refs copy in one shot:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-dev-profile.sh            # -> .dshdev-local (browser-safe: no probe)
scripts/bootstrap-dev-profile.sh --with-probe   # scripted rounds only (probe self-exits)
```

### Three test layers (and why the third exists)

| Layer | Command | Runs | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| unit | `npm test` (`tests/unit`) | node --test, no build, no network | pure core: registry, render, archive, notice, engine-core, tools, commands |
| integration | (today: probe rounds — see spikes/probe/README pattern) | boots real hosts in scratch homes | host wiring, realm mounts, provider economics |
| e2e (tape — the default loop) | `npm run test:e2e:replay` | same boots with `E2E_MODEL=replay`; model turns answered from `tests/fixtures/model-tape/<project>` via the record/replay proxy (`tests/e2e/model-proxy.ts`) — seconds, deterministic |
| e2e (distillation — occasional) | `npm run test:e2e:record` | `E2E_MODEL=record`: forwards every exchange to the real Local model and appends the tape. Run once per scenario; wipe `var/model-tape` first for a clean corpus; tapes are isolated per project (seven: suite/heavy/arrival/fanout/enrich/rules/fork); re-record when scenarios, prompts, or thresholds change. The GPU model is the DISTILLER, never the test oracle (user directive 2026-09-19) |
| e2e | `npm run test:e2e` (`tests/e2e`, SEVEN projects: suite/heavy/arrival/fanout/enrich/rules/fork) | Playwright + workspace-cached chromium vs a throwaway `var/e2e-home-<port>` rebuilt per boot (port-keyed so no boot can stomp another's state) (isolated from live agents — see FINDINGS 2026-09-19) | the browser: identity, fork button + switch, knowledge loop end-to-end, the oversized turn (mid-turn compactions), the subagent fan-out, arrival-time artifacting (low-floor project) |

The e2e layer exists because client-plane facts were being GUESSED (services, methods, tooltips,
switching) and every guess cost the user a browser round-trip. Playwright answers those in seconds
and its suite is the regression net for all future UI surface. Each project boots through
`boot.ts` (probe bundle removed first — it would otherwise kill the test server mid-suite; per-
project env pins: suite threshold 0.75, heavy 0.5 + arrival floor off, arrival floor 500 at the
production 0.9; homes are port-keyed). `discovery.spec.ts` keeps a health assertion on client-entry
activation, `fork-button.spec.ts` proves the click end-to-end on durable + visible planes, and the
heavy specs pin their claims to DURABLE facts (own-log turn/end, registry chapters, coverage) —
never to model verbosity. ACCEPTANCE DEFAULTS TO THE TAPE (`test:e2e:replay`, model turns served
from `tests/fixtures/model-tape/<project>` in seconds — explore: 14.7 s replayed vs 1.7 min live); the live
chain remains the distiller (`test:e2e:record`) and the ultimate witness. AGENTS-BLIND
masking (user decision 2026-09-20, reaffirmed 2026-10-01 with no exceptions): the tapes
stand in for ANOTHER project — a workspace docs edit (AGENTS.md, skill catalogs) NEVER
requires a re-record. The delimiter mask strips injected doc blocks from matching on both
sides, and a compaction summary that paraphrases doc prose (observed 2026-09-23 in
`heavy`/`fanout`) rides the tape as recorded model output — replay-side requests never
regenerate it, so committed tapes stay green across doc edits. Never gate a doc edit on
a distillation.

Re-record discipline (learned the hard way 2026-09-22/23):
- **A tape records the CONTEXT it was distilled in.** A spec replayed in a different
  predecessor set (or a different boot port before HOSTPORT-BLIND landed) sees different
  injected presence and misses. Re-record the whole project, not a single spec, when specs
  share a boot — and never run two GPU-consuming suites concurrently (RR2=137 + timeout
  cascades: a fanout that passes alone failed at 1.1 h while a heal chain shared the server).
  **Home freshness is part of the context** (measured 2026-09-29): the host injects
  skill-catalog-changed and runtime-context snapshot notices on the FIRST boot against a
  fresh/absent throwaway home. Distilling against a stale home produced a tape without those
  messages that a pristine replay then demanded — structural message-count divergence, which
  no content mask can bridge. Discipline: `rm -rf var/e2e-home-<port>` before RECORD and
  before the verifying REPLAY, so both sides saw the same boot world. Hosted CI is inherently
  pristine: a locally-distilled tape that passes only on an accumulated home is a red flag,
  not a pass.
- **Ports are parameterized end to end**: the model proxy derives `E2E_PROXY_PORT = boot port
  + 1000` (a hard-coded 41799 turned one killed run's orphan into EADDRINUSE for every later
  boot), and `boot.ts` fails FAST with a named-port message when the boot port is already
  owned (an orphan's silence cost 20+ minutes of opaque hangs). Kill leftovers:
  `pkill -f "dsh web --port 417"`.
- **The tape's matching is normalized on BOTH sides** — legacy stored prefixes are re-run
  through `substituteAll` at load, so a new volatile rule (HOSTPORT-BLIND, `e2e-home-\d+`)
  repairs older tapes without a re-record. Prefer that route over distilling again.
- **When a browser scenario fails, suspect its own tooling before the product.** The
  parked-for-eras `rules` e2e was a spec reading zstd-compressed directories as flat files
  (fixed 2026-09-23 with the session.ts `zstd -dc` route + dynamic rule-id capture); the
  enrich e2e exposed two REAL product bugs (the frontmatter-anchor convention mismatch and
  the missing host-plane route) that every deterministic layer had missed because each side
  only ever tested against its own convention. The e2e is the integration witness — keep it.

### The coverage ledgers (added 2026-09-23 by the coverage audit; gated same day)

- `npm run coverage:ci` — **the gate CI enforces.** `c8 --check-coverage
  --statements 85 --branches 85 --functions 85 --lines 85` over the whole
  deterministic suite (unit + integration in one process graph; live TreeDX
  rows self-skip when the container is down, so it passes on a runner with no
  TreeDX and no LLM). Below any threshold it exits non-zero; the report lands
  in `var/coverage/` and the summary is posted to the CI job page. Current
  ledger: **97.98% stmts / 85.61% branch / 93.62% funcs** across 450 tests.
  The branch number is the binding one (defensive `??`/ternary arms dominate
  the miss count); it is deliberately kept above 85 by the `*-branches.test.ts`
  sweep files rather than by lowering the bar.
- `npm run coverage` — the same deterministic suite under node's native
  `--experimental-test-coverage` (a quick second opinion; no gate).
- `npm run coverage:e2e` — replays the seven browser segments with
  `E2E_COVERAGE=1`, which makes every boot write NODE_V8_COVERAGE profiles
  under `var/e2e-cov/<port>` (flushed on the boot's clean exit), then runs
  `scripts/e2e-coverage.mjs` → **c8 with real source maps** (tsconfig
  `sourceMap: true`; lib/*.js maps back to src/*.ts) for istanbul-grade
  per-module Stmts/Branch/Funcs. Read it as "covered by SOME boot of the
  suite" (a union), and mind the script header's c8 gotcha: include/exclude
  filters apply BEFORE remapping, so `--include=src/**` would silently
  zero every row. First full ledger: 80% stmts / 62% branches overall;
  tools.ts 72/49, engine.ts 81/59, index.ts 86/55 — plus the honest plane
  split (src/treedx reads low HERE because the browser suite rides git;
  the deterministic + live ledgers own that transport).
  Both ledgers together are the coverage claim; neither alone is honest.

### Release status (measured 2026-09-25)

`@treeseed/dsh-chapters@0.1.0` is LIVE on npmjs.org — published manually from
the CI-verified tag (`npm publish --access public --provenance=false`; the
registry shasum matches the CI tree byte-for-byte, install-smoke green).
Manual because the Production environment's NPM_TOKEN cannot CREATE a
package it is not scoped to (E404 = granular-token scope limitation, not a
secret problem) — and that whole class of auth is now gone: **CI publishes
run on npm TRUSTED PUBLISHING (OIDC)**. release.yml carries no token;
setup-node gets `registry-url` but never a `token:` (any `_authToken` in an
npmrc overrides the OIDC path), `id-token: write` is the credential, and the
npm side must register this package's Trusted Publisher as: repo
`treeseed-ai/dsh-chapters`, branch `main`, workflow `release.yml`,
environment `Production`. Prerelease versions publish under a matching
dist-tag so 'latest' stays stable. `0.1.1` is the first OIDC + provenance
ship; `0.1.0` itself carries no attestation.

### Hosted CI (`.github/workflows/`, wired + dress-rehearsed 2026-09-23)

- **`ci.yml`** — two jobs. `test`: `npm ci` (all deps public on
  registry.npmjs.org — **no install secret**), typecheck, build,
  `coverage:ci` (the 85/85/85/85 gate). `e2e-replay`: installs the pinned
  host (`npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.5-rc.1` — the SAME version as the
  gate line in `scripts/ci-replay.sh`, which fails loudly on mismatch) plus
  chromium's apt libs, then `scripts/ci-replay.sh` — seven browser segments
  served entirely from the committed tapes. **No LLM, no key, no GPU:** in
  replay mode `localModelUp()` short-circuits to true (specs RUN, they do not
  skip) and a tape miss is a loud proxy 503, so a scenario that legitimately
  changed fails the job instead of silently passing.
- **`release.yml`** — bare-semver tag (`0.1.0`, matching the Production
     environment's `*.*.*` tag protection) or manual dispatch → the full
     gated deterministic suite as publish blocker → `npm publish
     --provenance`. Two token facts learned the hard way (measured on the
     first ship): the token must be written into the file npm actually reads
     (setup-node exports `NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG` — `~/.npmrc` is ignored),
     and the FIRST publish of a new package name needs a granular token with
     'Read and publish' over ALL packages (a package-scoped token 404s — it
     cannot be scoped to a package that does not exist yet; narrow it to
     `dsh-chapters` after the first ship).
  --provenance`. Auth path B is OIDC trusted publishing (no long-lived
  secret); path A uses `NPM_TOKEN` if configured.
- The dress rehearsal on a pristine machine caught three real blockers, all
  fixed and pinned: (1) `bootstrap-dev-profile.sh` refused the comments-only
  `cordis.patch.yml` scaffold that `dsh plugin add` lays down on a fresh home
  — the guard now only protects patches with real entries; (2) a credential-
  less home boots but every session dies composing the local provider —
  tape-mode boots now inject a dummy `LOCAL_API_KEY` (the proxy ignores
  auth; a real env key always wins); (3) **a fresh home has no registered
  workspace**, so the UI's New-session draft never commits — every browser
  spec dies at `newSessionWithTurn` (this had been masked for weeks by
  accumulated state in the dev home — the exact class of drift CI exists to
  catch). The bootstrap now seeds `storages/workspace.json` (exact host
  schema: ISO dates, `updatedAt`, registered path = the checkout) when absent.

### Safe default guard

Prefix every harness command with `DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev` — or do not type it at all:
**`scripts/dsh-scratch.sh` is that wrapper** (`--home .dshdev2` for a parallel profile; it refuses any
resolved home under the real `~/.dsh` and execs `dsh` with `DSH_HOME` exported).

This stopped being advice the hard way: during Stage 0 a bare `dsh plugin --profile web add ...` (no
`DSH_HOME`) targeted the LIVE profile — the sandbox's read-only `~/.dsh` turned it into a harmless
`pnpm failed` and the live `package.json` mtime proved nothing was touched, but "the sandbox protects us"
is not a guard rail. Any future command form that can reach `~/.dsh` must route through the wrapper.

## Test Layers

Adopted from how the reference plugins actually iterate (they mostly *avoid* restarting the host):
`dsh-session-fork` has ~8,000 lines across 28 `bun test` files and **every test file header says "no
cordis"** — logic takes an injected `Ports` interface and only `makePorts(ctx)` touches the kernel. Copy
that shape, and fix its one gap (§L1).

### L0 — Pure logic, no cordis, no harness

Ranges validation, the chapter renderer, TOC assembly, budget math, slug/number allocation. Fast, CI-able,
no DSH at all. Structure for it from day one:

```ts
// src/continue.ts — no cordis import anywhere in this module
export interface ContinuePorts {
  readSession(id: string): Promise<SourceLog | null>
  createContinuation(opts: { sessionId: string; seed: readonly SessionEvent[]; cwd?: string }): Promise<void>
  reserveNumbers(key: string, count: number): Promise<number[]>
  putRegistry(state: SessionState): Promise<void>
}
export async function runContinue(ports: ContinuePorts, args: ContinueArgs): Promise<ContinueResult>
```

`src/index.ts` is then the **only** cordis-facing file — a thin adapter, deliberately untested.

### L1 — A *stateful* seed fake (where the reference plugin fell short)

`dsh-session-fork`'s `createChildFromSeed` fake records `cut` as a number and validates nothing: it proves
*which* port calls happened in *what* order, never what the kernel does with a seed. Our seed is one
synthetic event, so a ~30-line fake can close that hole cheaply — **materialize** the seed and assert:

- seqs contiguous from `0`, our notice at `seq = 0`
- `surfaceOp: 'append'`
- `inheritedEventCount` equals `seed.length`
- the message source we emit is inside the kernel's accepted vocabulary

That last bullet is `dsh-session-fork`'s most expensive lesson: a retired message source **bricked 66
stored logs** which then refused to load, and they now pin the rule in a `format-watch` test because the
validator isn't published. Our TOC is a synthetic `user/message` — pin the vocabulary test *first*, not
after a chain of corrupted session files. Their `replaySurface()` idea (re-fold the durable log, assert it
equals the live surface) is the right invariant to steal wholesale.

### L2 — Boot-time probe in an isolated profile → **this is how Phase 0 runs**

No LLM, no tokens, no HTTP driving, no restart of anything:

1. Write the probe as a minimal plugin whose `apply()` runs the experiment during boot and writes JSON
   facts to a file in the workspace.
2. Install into the **scratch** profile. `dsh plugin add` runs pnpm and may reach for the network; if it
   does, bypass it by symlinking the package into `.dshdev/profiles/web/node_modules/` and adding its id
   via a `--patch` overlay (`dsh --patch <file>` applies an extra patch layer at boot).
3. `DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev dsh web --port 0 --no-open`, let it boot, read the JSON.

Phase 0 questions it answers: is an unseeded/one-event-seeded `agents.create` durable, listed, and
resumable; does `Session.create` accept the seed; does workspace attach work; does the child's header match.

### L3 — Headless one-shot with a real model (only when a measurement needs it)

`dsh --profile headless "…"` boots a profile, answers one task, prints, and exits — scriptable. The
headless bundle emits JSON with `usage.cacheReadTokens`, which is the only way to get the cache numbers
G1–G3 in `docs/verify.md` without a browser.

Costs real model tokens and needs credentials: `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` is *inside* the relocated
root, so a scratch home starts unauthenticated. **Copying the user's credentials into a scratch root is
their call — ask before doing it, and ask before spending tokens on a measured run.** Prefer L0/L1 for
correctness and reserve L3 for the few numeric assertions.

### L4 — Upstream drift pins

The habit that lets you iterate against a moving host without booting it: text-pin what you depend on in
the *installed* bundles and fail loudly on drift.

- `parity`-style: run the real published package against any vendored copy of its logic.
- `upstream-watch`-style: assert literal call sites still look the way our assumption says (e.g. that
  `session.fork` still seeds with `events.slice(0, cut)` — the fact invariant 2 rests on).
- `vendor`-style: pin `file:line` + SHA markers in a header comment and assert they still exist.

On failure, the procedure is *re-read upstream and re-anchor*, never "relax the assertion".

## Speed Notes — What Made This Fast

Learned while running eleven probe boots. Each is a concrete loop improvement, not a preference.

**One env var is the whole isolation story.** `DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev` cost nothing to adopt and removed
the restart problem entirely. Every harness command in this repo should carry it — wrap them in
`scripts/` or a `Makefile` so the bare form never appears in a doc or a shell history.

**Failures before the provider are free.** Round 10's every turn errored on `{{model}}` assembly and
spent **zero** tokens. A probe that fails early costs a boot, not a bill — which means it is cheap to
probe aggressively and wrong. Prefer a probe that might error over reading five more source files.

**Plain `.js` probes beat a build step.** The spike needed no TypeScript, no `tsc`, no `lib/` output:
write `lib/roundN.js`, point `package.json` `main` at it, boot, read JSON. Ten seconds of edit-build-test
with no compile errors to fight. Keep the *real* plugin in TypeScript; keep the *spike* in JS.

**Reading the host's own session logs is the fastest source of truth.** `~/.dsh/sessions/<projectKey>/<id>/session.v3.jsonl.zstd`
shows exactly what a real `user/message` looks like, which `source.kind` values are in play, and how large a
request header actually is — all without a model call. Two gotchas that each cost a cycle:

- `zstd -dc <path>` **fails** on these paths: they begin `--home-…` and are parsed as flags. Use
  `zstd -dc -- <path>`.
- Paths are bucketed by `projectKey(cwd)` (`session-persistence-jsonl/src/format.ts:224`), so a project
  directory is encoded with `-` separators, e.g. `--home-adrian-Projects-dsh-chapter-fork--`.

**`Function.prototype.toString` is useless on the bundled host** — service methods report
`function () { [native code] }`. Do not plan to discover signatures by introspection; grep the
`examples/deepseek-harness` checkout instead. Three signatures cost one wasted boot each when guessed:
`listSessions(signal?)` is **positional**, `agents.resume({ resumeSessionId })` is an **options object**,
and `create` needs `agentOptions` plus a preset.

**TypeScript tests run with zero install and zero build — use this before reaching for vitest.**
`node --test tests/unit/*.test.ts` executes `.ts` directly on Node 24 via type stripping, so the pure core
(`src/render.ts`, `src/types.ts`) is covered by 15 tests in ~135 ms with **no `node_modules` at all**. That
keeps the L0/L1 layer free: no dependency resolution, no bundler, no config, and it works inside the agent
sandbox where an install may not. `npm test` is wired to it.

Reserve the vitest/bun decision for when kernel-facing mocks need more than Node's runner gives, and note
that `npm run typecheck` **does** need `typescript` + `@types/node` installed — a separate step from
testing, deliberately not taken yet.

**Keep probe turns tiny.** `Reply with exactly: ALPHA. No explanation.` finishes in one step and a few
tokens, so a measurement that needs five real turns still costs pocket change.

**Instrument the metric, not just the code.** The cache numbers only became readable once the formula was
pinned: `totalPrompt = inputTokens + cacheReadTokens`, `hit = cacheReadTokens / totalPrompt`. Dividing by
the uncached delta instead produces values like 1721% and quietly wrong conclusions — which is exactly what
happened in these notes before it was caught.

## Implementation Status (kept current)

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| `src/types.ts`, `src/render.ts` — pure chapter renderer, ranges, fence safety, artifact deferral | **done**, 15 tests |
| `src/archive.ts` — reserve→write→verify ordering, dedup, idempotent retry, coverage, tamper detection | **done**, 11 tests |
| `src/notice.ts` + `test/notice.test.ts` — TOC-notice builder, kernel-rejection reproduction, vocabulary pins + drift guard (Phase 0b check 5) | **done**, 10 tests |
| `src/registry.ts` + `src/store.ts` — pure numbering/ancestry/plan state; zod domain spec, storage-domain + node-fs adapters | **done**, 13 + 7 tests; durability witness passed |
| `src/engine-core.ts` + `src/engine.ts` — ChaptersCompactionEngine | **done & boot-proven** (r18/r19: realm subpath row mounts; real cascade finalizes; catch-path fix — FINDINGS § Phase 1) |
| `presets/chapters/` + copy-on-boot install | **done & boot-proven** (r21; `!!js` has no `require`, so copying is the delivery mechanism — r20) |
| `npm test` (unit + integration) | **188 passing, <2 s** — unit imports no harness services; integration runs the sync loop against a fake git driver AND a real git smart-HTTP server (git-http-backend on loopback; the git binary is test-only scaffolding, the product stays pure-JS) |
| 20-check verify.md pass | **r26/26b**: 18 mechanical on `.dshdev2` (refusals with numbers, tamper marks, idempotent retry, cross-boot registry + resume); human rows per verify.md evidence map |
| dsh-session-fork coexistence | **moot at this version** (r26a pair-boot): the example fails to boot the installed host ALONE (unguarded `webServer` read in the installed dsh-client-connection) — assumed-neutral until a version-matched pair-boot |
| `scripts/dsh-scratch.sh` | **done** — refuses any DSH_HOME under the live `~/.dsh`; the near-miss is in FINDINGS |
| `chapters_segment` / `chapters_continue` / `chapters_fork` tools (`src/tools.ts` → `continue-core.ts`) | **done & boot-proven** (r22 9/9 full loop incl. child read-back; r24 fork siblings reserve nothing; r25 durable title; r26/26b checklist pass) |
| E3: header cache across a compaction | **measured, per-machine (r23 cloud, r28 local)**: cloud held 7,424 cached across the replacement (refill 13,658 → ~7,000); local llama.cpp reuses NOTHING across a head replacement (0 cached) but steady-state turns cost only the new content. Never quote one machine's number for the other |
| Fork button | **shipped** (client bundle + slots; `remote.commands` trigger — `connection.rpc.handle` from a plugin is broken on this host, r26a; the button rides the command path instead) |
| Long-context mechanics (architecture amendments) | **built + verified**: arrival-time artifacting (`src/arrival.ts`, `chapters_artifact`; e2e artifact-arrival green — 373KB book never prefilled, cache intact) and plot carriage (persona PLOT: + elicited fallback); e2e = 7 specs / 2 projects on a throwaway per-boot home (188 unit/integration) |
| Knowledge layer P1 (record §13) | **complete**: project identity, redaction, live turn signatures, topic-sequential composition (fork proven live, r36; engine wired, r29), sharded index + incremental manifest, `chapters_search`, `/chapters-link`+`/chapters-status`+notice v2 (Project line, `(N msgs)`), the sync loop with §5.3 local-only degradation + diverged-rebuild, both schedulers and all §5.1 triggers wired. 9/9 live (r35j) + the two-machine exit criterion PROVEN as a browser journey (e2e suite green 2026-09-18) (composer→real remote→machine B searches) |
| Topic mapping (composer) | **live-verified at the fork (r36)**: same-topic turns merge into one chapter on real signatures; topic changes split; pressure fragments stay legacy (measured, documented §4.2/4.3 + FINDINGS r28-36) — engine composition (r29) waits for deep selections |
| `npm run typecheck` / `npm run build` | **working** — typescript 5.9 + @types/node + host packages as devDeps; `.ts`-import convention kept via `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` |

Two bugs the pure tests caught that would have been expensive later, which is the argument for this order:

1. `coverage()` started its cursor at the first chapter, so a chapter set that skipped the **opening** of a
   conversation reported no gap — silent history loss, exactly the failure the plugin exists to prevent.
2. Substring assertions against `/chapters/` matched the store root `.dsh-chapters/` first. Worth knowing
   as a general hazard: **the default store root name contains the word `chapters`**, so any path matching
   in real code must anchor on the separator.

## Unavoidably Manual

Say it rather than pretend the suite covers it:

| Needs a human | Why |
|---|---|
| Sidebar listing and visual resume of a continuation | no client-side harness reaches the real module loader contract |
| Cache/prefill economics across process generations | inherently multi-process; a restart recomposes every header |
| TOC readability and whether the model actually reloads chapters | judgement about prose and behaviour |
| The Phase 0 verdict itself, read from probe output | L2 produces the facts; a human confirms the interpretation |

## The TreeDX dev loop (knowledge transport provider #2)

The TreeDX transport (`src/treedx/`, contract in `docs/provider.md`) is developed against an
**in-process stub service** — `tests/integration/treedx-stub-server.ts` — which is part of the
normal `npm test` loop (real HTTP on loopback, no docker, ~400 ms). The stub's semantics are
the documented ones (bearer 401, one writable lease per branch, fail-closed moved-base commit,
UTF-8 1 MiB File cap); when a real service disagrees, the live test below catches it and the
stub changes to match — never the other way.

The real service, for the exit-criterion run:

```bash
# the HOST user drives docker (the agent sandbox has the docker group stripped; its
# HTTP view of the booted service is fine — that is where live tests execute from)
scripts/treedx-local.sh up                     # builds examples/treedx (dev target); FIRST BOOT compiles the Rust NIF — minutes
scripts/treedx-local.sh token                  # dev-token (30d), writes var/treedx-dev.env (gitignored, 0600)
scripts/treedx-local.sh smoke                  # the six-step transport walk via curl
node --test tests/integration/treedx-live.test.ts   # the §13 exit criterion over the real API
scripts/treedx-local.sh down                   # stop; the data volume persists (down -v wipes)
```

`treedx-live.test.ts` skips ONLY when unconfigured (no env, no `var/treedx-dev.env`):
configured-but-unreachable FAILS loudly — the skip flag is decided at load time, and a
test that silently declines to witness after being told to run is broken tooling (a real
bug class caught 2026-09-21, by the human, by running it). Proven live 2026-09-21:
6/6 live tests green, full suite 286/286 with zero skips.
`dev/treedx.compose.yaml` exists because the cloned repo's own `compose.yaml` is bound to the
Treeseed platform network + connected auth and will not boot standalone (measured; recorded in
`spikes/treedx/FINDINGS.md` §Environment). The cloned checkout under `examples/treedx/` is
gitignored reference material — the live loop works from any path via `TREEDX_LOCAL_*` overrides.

## Command Reference

```bash
# disposable instance — prefer the wrapper (DSH_HOME is its problem, not yours):
#   NOTE: .dshdev mounts dsh-chapters-probe, whose rounds process.exit when done — fine for
#   scripted one-shot boots, WRONG for an interactive test (the server dies seconds after the
#   URL prints). Manual testing belongs to .dshdev2 (plugin only; probe removed 2026-09-17).
scripts/dsh-scratch.sh web --port 0 --no-open                    # .dshdev (probe home)
scripts/dsh-scratch.sh --home .dshdev2 web --port 0 --no-open    # clean home for the real plugin

# manual form, if the wrapper is unavailable:
mkdir -p .dshdev
DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev dsh web --port 0 --no-open

# inspect the composed bundle tree of a profile without booting it
DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev dsh --profile web --dump-config | head

# add our plugin to the SCRATCH profile only
scripts/dsh-scratch.sh --home .dshdev2 plugin --profile web add "link:$(pwd)"

# one-shot headless run (needs credentials in the scratch root; costs tokens)
DSH_HOME=$PWD/.dshdev dsh --profile headless "list your tools"

# unit tests
bun test        # or vitest — decide in Phase 0, see docs/architecture.md § Open Questions
```

**Never** run `dsh plugin --profile web add` or `dsh web` without `DSH_HOME=` set to the scratch root:
that is the profile and port this session is running on.

## Correction to Earlier Claims in This Repo

Two things I asserted before checking, now that they are checkable:

1. **"`dsh web` runs in a tmux pane on the dev fork at `/app/checkout`"** — wrong for this machine. There
   is no `tmux` binary and no `/app/checkout`; the harness serving this session is the global npm install
   on `:3080`. The dev fork is `~/Projects/deepseek-harness`.
2. **An isolated instance's port.** I first reported `34159` from a garbled read; the actual boot printed
   `32869`. The curl to `34159` failing was the tell — it was my number, not the server's.

Both are worth recording rather than quietly fixing, since the whole point of this file is that its
commands were *verified*.

## Suggested Additions to the Other Docs

`docs/contract.md`'s file:line citations are from the `examples/` snapshot (rc.1-era), not the rc.2 fork —
re-anchor them against whichever version a test actually boots.
