# Open items — 2026-10-11

Handoff for a fresh session. Everything below is *scoped and reachable*; none of it is a unknown
defect. Shipped state: **0.1.13** (tag = npm `latest` = the user's installed profile), hosted CI green
(deterministic gate + eight-project tape chain), and the untagged commit after it (`5bdc11b`) changes
only the e2e stub and this record.

Order matters: 1 and 2 are the ones that change what we are allowed to *claim*.

## 1. Live-model proof of the plans journey

**What is missing.** Every acceptance claim for plan carriage runs off a tape distilled from the
scripted upstream (`tests/e2e/stub-model.ts`), because this box's model server was in a CUDA-OOM
restart loop. The behaviour at our seam is proven; "a real model plans, a human approves, the
continuation carries it" is not.

**What attempt 5 already bought** (see `tests/fixtures/model-tape/plans/PROVENANCE.md`): a real
`exit_plan_mode` submission, the host review answered by a real click, `plan/mode` flipping
active→inactive on approval, the archived chapter carrying the plan, and the **branch** child receiving
zero directive bytes — all with a live model. What it did *not* buy: the continuation leg, because the
model called `chapters_segment` and then answered in prose.

**How to close it.** The container is now `RestartCount=0` with `N_PARALLEL` removed.

1. Prove a **completion**, not a health check: `curl` a real ~14K-token chat request and confirm it
   finishes. `/v1/models` answering proves nothing (measured repeatedly).
2. Run the journey live: `E2E_MODEL=live E2E_PORT=41850 E2E_THRESHOLD=0.99 E2E_NO_AUX_MODEL=1
   npx playwright test -c tests/e2e/playwright.config.ts --project=plans`
3. Expect cost: ~15 tok/s decode means several minutes per turn, and with one slot this session's own
   turns queue behind it. Do it when the box is otherwise free.
4. Record the outcome in `PROVENANCE.md` either way — including a failure and its cause. Do **not**
   promote the scripted tape's status based on a live run that only half-completed.

**Honest limit.** A live journey is inherently non-deterministic (attempt 5 proved the model may chain
two calls or may not). It is evidence, never a CI gate. Do not try to make it one.

## 2. The seeded-gate row in a browser

**What is missing.** The seeded `plan/mode` into a continuation child (§ 10 of
`docs/plans-carriage.md`) is proven by a kernel probe and by deterministic rows, but never *observed*
in a real session.

**Already done, and it is the hard part:** the session shape was reached live-in-the-harness and
recorded — `plan/mode {active:true}` at seq 4, `turn/end` at 21, **no** tool call. So a session can be
in plan mode with a completed turn, which gives the deterministic door a real ceiling to archive
against. The attempt was reverted unshipped for two harness reasons, both now fixed on `main`:

- the stub had to learn to answer **plainly** in plan mode (`kind: 'plain'`), and its "is the human
  asking for a plan?" test first read the **last** user message — but the harness appends its own
  injected user messages (workspace instructions, runtime snapshot, skill catalog) *after* the human's,
  so the ask was invisible and the next step hung 15 minutes on a review card that could not appear.
  Now it scans every user-role message, the trigger is a whole sentence so the plan-mode *policy* text
  cannot set it off, and both properties are pinned by rows in `tests/unit/stub-model.test.ts`.
- a **stale stub process** was serving pre-edit logic, which made a harness bug look like a product
  one. Restart the upstream before trusting any distillation.

**Remaining work.** Re-add the leg (draft is in this file's history of the repo: new session → `/plan`
with a plain ask → wait for `plan/mode` + `turn/end` → `/chapters-continue` → poll `ch-` children for a
`plan/mode` event at seq 1 with `active:true`, assert exactly one `dsh-chapters` user/message, and
assert the notice carries **no** plan section since no plan was submitted). Then re-distill the plans
tape with a **fresh** stub and replay it. Roughly 15–20 minutes.

## 3. Per-message anchoring (needs a product decision, not just code)

`deriveRanges` already accepts any anchor, and the fork/continue doors archive from the watermark. What
does not exist is a way for a human to say *"branch from this message"*, because the button acts at
conversation end. Two open questions before code:

- where the affordance lives (message action row vs selection in the composer), and
- **how the child is told what it did not inherit** — an anchored branch silently drops the tail, which
  is exactly the kind of unstated loss this project refuses. It needs a line in the notice.

Scope it as its own plan; do not fold it into a release.

## 4. Default-preset shipping policy (the user's call)

Today `chapters` is opt-in: the profile must name it, and the README/site tell users how. The
alternative — make it the default agent preset — changes every new session's header. That is a
distribution decision with a cache consequence (a recomposed header is measured at ~12K tokens on a
32K model) and it belongs to the human, not to an agent. Ask before touching it.

## 5. Human-judgment verification rows

Still open and still human-only: readability of a real checkpoint in a real browser, and whether the
notice/preamble *feels* right to work in. These are not automatable and should not be faked with
assertions. `docs/verify.md` lists them; run them after installing, in the project you actually care
about.

## Also worth knowing

- **Durability caveat for a new project:** with no pool linked, the archive lives only in the
  workspace. `/chapters-link <path-or-url>` is the difference between "this machine remembers" and
  "the project remembers".
- **Search now answers unlinked** (0.1.12) and says which door it used. If a result ever looks
  machine-only when you expected the pool, that note is the first thing to read.
- **`/chapters-continue` vs `/chapters-fork`** is the intent line: continue carries the operative plan
  and may seed plan mode; fork carries nothing.
