/**
 * A SESSION PLAN, carried: plan mode in the browser, a real `exit_plan_mode`
 * submission, the host's own review card answered by a click, a fork — and the
 * child's own log calling that plan out while its full bytes sit on disk.
 *
 * The acceptance row for docs/plans-carriage.md § 4/§ 5, and the ONLY layer that
 * exercises the host's review exchange (the deterministic plane reads log-shaped
 * fixtures; this makes the harness write them).
 *
 * CLIENT-PLANE FACTS, MEASURED — not guessed:
 *  - plan-mode chip accessible names: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-plan/lib/client.js:61-98`
 *    ("Plan mode off, press to turn on" / "Plan mode on, press to turn off");
 *  - the review question and its two labels: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-plan-mode/lib/index.js:259-276`
 *    ("Approve this plan and leave plan mode?" / "Approve" / "Keep planning");
 *  - options render as buttons named by their label
 *    (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-user-questions/lib/client.js:276, 601`);
 *  - the chapters fork action: `button[aria-label="Fork with chapters"]`, measured
 *    live in fork-button.spec.ts.
 *
 * WHY THE TURN IS DRIVEN BY HAND (and not with newSessionWithTurn): the review is
 * AWAITED inside the tool call, so `turn/end` cannot arrive until a human answers.
 * The helper therefore waits for the card, clicks, and only then waits for the
 * turn to close — the shape the host actually produces.
 *
 * THE MODEL IS A SCRIPTED UPSTREAM on this box (tests/e2e/stub-model.ts): the wire
 * format is copied from recorded llama.cpp traffic, so the harness's provider, the
 * tool runtime, the review channel and the durable log are all REAL; only the
 * decision to submit a plan is scripted. What this journey therefore proves is the
 * carriage, not model behaviour — and the GPU box can re-record the same project
 * from the live model, which retires the stub (docs/plans-carriage.md § Tapes).
 * Assertions read the DURABLE plane: files on disk and the child's own log,
 * addressed by the identity localStorage reports.
