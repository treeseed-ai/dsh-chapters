/**
 * The host-drift gate for preset DELIVERY.
 *
 * Presets changed mechanism at host 0.1.7-alpha.1: `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/<id>/` is no
 * longer read at all, and a preset is an `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` *declaration row*.
 * The failure mode of a mechanism change nobody noticed is the interesting part — nothing
 * crashes. The plugin boots, its tools register, Settings says "enabled and running", the
 * preset is absent, and `resume` then throws `agent-preset/not-found` for every session whose
 * log recorded it. A user's chapters sessions look corrupted; their logs are intact.
 *
 * The preset ships as a row in OUR bundle patch (`cordis.patch.yml`, id `preset-chapters`) so
 * it is a visible Loader entry like the host's own `preset-standard` — and the row's plugin is
 * ours (`@treeseed/dsh-chapters/preset`), which mirrors the host's line for line and drops
 * rows this host cannot import before registering. Why the host package is not named directly,
 * and why disposal works the way it does, are recorded with their measurements in
 * `src/preset.ts`.
 *
 * So these rows guard what would otherwise make the next host rename a broken user session:
 *   1. the shipped row is well-formed, and `config.id` is `chapters` — that id is DURABLE
 *      STATE inside other people's session logs, so renaming it orphans those sessions;
 *   2. every module the composition mounts resolves against a real host install, and anything
 *      that does not is in the declared optional set (the row prunes those at boot and says
 *      so) — one unresolvable child makes the WHOLE preset `broken`;
 *   3. our list differs from the host's own standard list ONLY by the declared deltas;
 *   4. no row carries a config key some supported host REJECTS (alpha.4 throws on `toolFilter`;
 *      a refused key breaks every session, so zod-stripping was not the answer);
 *   5. every `{{variable}}` referenced is one the installed host registers — the legacy suffix
 *      interpolated `{{cwd}}`, hosts from 0.2.1-alpha.2 register only `provider`/`model`, and
 *      interpolation THROWS, so a preset that composes perfectly still breaks every turn;
 *   6. the persona suffix is still keyed to the plot-extraction echo guard, because that guard
 *      matches phrases inside the suffix and the coupling is invisible from either side;
 *   7. the registration arms (registered / pruned / already-declared / unsupported / failed)
 *      and the roster arms (present / broken / absent / unknown) classify correctly — their log
 *      lines are the only health signal a plugin can produce about a preset it does not own;
 *   8. `dsh.bundle.patch` stays a STRING, the patch file stays packed, and `./preset` stays
 *      exported: a row the manifest cannot ship, or a package that stopped exporting its row
 *      module, is a preset that vanished with no error naming the cause.
 *
 * Rows 2/3/4 run only when the host's web bundle resolves (same RUN/SKIP discipline as
 * host-seed-contract.test.ts: unmeasured must be named, not quietly green). The pinned e2e
 * host predates declaration rows and ships no `dsh-web-app` preset list, so on that closure
 * they SKIP by name — they still fire on a box or CI job carrying a 0.2.x host.
 *
 * Parsed line-wise rather than with a YAML library: none is a dependency of this tree, and a
 * structural reader is stricter than `yaml.load` — it cannot silently swallow a mis-indented
 * row. Comments are dropped first, so a gate never fires on its own documentation (it did once).
