#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/ci-gate.sh — run the deterministic coverage gate and, when it fails,
# put the WHY into the run's annotations.
#
# Why this exists (measured 2026-10-10, the 0.1.6 ship): `npm run coverage:ci`
# exits 1 with its whole diagnosis on stdout, the `test summary` step is gated
# `if: always()`… no it wasn't — it was a plain step, so a red gate SKIPPED it and
# the job's only surviving artifact was a 5.7 MB coverage bundle that the API
# serves behind a token. A maintainer watching from the API (or from a phone) got
# "Process completed with exit code 1" and nothing else, while the same commit
# passed on every local reproduction. The gate must state, in the annotations:
# which metric fell under the threshold, and which tests failed.
#
# Behaviour: runs the gate, tees its output to var/ci-gate.log, and on failure
# emits ::error:: lines (coverage totals + up to 20 failing-test lines) before
# re-exiting with the gate's own code. On success it prints one summary line.
