# CI acceptance: replay the committed model tapes — no local model, no GPU, no
# LLM API key. Every model turn is served by tests/e2e/model-proxy.ts from the
# committed corpus under tests/fixtures/model-tape/<project>/ (seven projects:
# suite, fork, heavy, arrival, enrich, fanout, rules). A tape MISS is a loud proxy
# 503 that fails the run; with E2E_MODEL=replay (and no E2E_TAPE_FALLBACK=1)
# the proxy never reaches a live server — this proves the acceptance suite
# green on a machine with no model present.
#
# Prerequisites, verified below, failing LOUDLY (never skipped) if unmet:
#   - the pinned DSH host on PATH (the e2e boot spawns the INSTALLED `dsh`,
#     not a devDependency) — installed project-scoped in its own prefix (see
#     ci.yml's tree-shape note; plain `npm i -g` yields a broken host tree)
#   - Playwright chromium (this script installs it into var/ms-playwright)
#   - the host itself comes from dev/dsh-host-lock (npm ci, hermetic lock)
#   - git with the http-backend (knowledge.spec drives a real smart-HTTP
#     remote; ubuntu-latest ships it)
