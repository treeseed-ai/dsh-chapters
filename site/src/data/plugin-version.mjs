/**
 * The ONE build-time source of the plugin's version. Plain `.mjs` so both the
 * Astro config (a remark plugin needs it synchronously at config time) and the
 * TS data module can import it without a second copy of the logic.
 *
 * Why not the npm registry: a docs build that reaches the network can only ever
 * print a number that is true for the second it ran, and an offline build must
 * not hard-fail. The repo's own `package.json` is authoritative at every release
 * commit — `release.yml` refuses to publish unless the tag equals it — so the
 * version this site documents is the version that shipped. Anything a human is
 * told to RUN says `@latest` and needs no number at all.
 *
 * The search is deliberate: `import.meta.url` inside the bundler is NOT a stable
 * anchor (a naive `../../../package.json` silently lands on `site/package.json`,
 * version `0.0.1`), so every candidate is validated by its own package `name`
 * before it is trusted. Nothing is hardcoded and nothing is guessed.
