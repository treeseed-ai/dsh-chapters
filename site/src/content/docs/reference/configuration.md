description: Every knob, which plane it lives on, and the one rule that ties them together.

No hardcoded tunables anywhere the harness can configure them. The table below is the complete host-plane list (the `config` schema in `src/index.ts`); the comment header of the shipped `cordis.patch.yml` (inside `node_modules/@treeseed/dsh-chapters/`) mirrors the schema and is the in-repo reference, but this page is kept current with the code.

**Two planes.** `config` (below) is the *host plane* — your profile's plugin entry. The compaction *engine* lives on the *realm plane*: the `chapters` agent-preset row (the `preset-chapters` declaration row at the foot of the bundle's `cordis.patch.yml`, mounted by `src/preset.ts`), which owns `thresholdRatio`, `retainRatio/retainTokens`, `maxTokens`, `compactionRetries/maxOverflowRetries`, `summarizationProvider/summarizationModel` (legacy override), `enrichmentTrigger` (`afterPush|idle|both|manual`), `elicitedPlot`, and `toolResultArtifactTokens`. Shared names behave per plane — design record §12.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `harnessId` | hostname | this machine's identity: commit author, curation partition, rule authorship |
| `knowledgeRemote` | `''` | pre-bind an upstream (else `/chapters-link`) |
| `knowledgeProvider` | `auto` | transport policy: `auto` dispatches on the remote scheme (`treedx+` → TreeDX, else git); an explicit `git`/`treedx` must match the scheme or the link refuses |
| `projectKeyOverride` | `''` | wins over the remote-derived project key |
| `syncDebounceMs` | 30000 | coalesce window for post-archive pushes |
| `treedxFetchTimeoutMs` / `treedxWorkspaceTtlSeconds` / `treedxLeaseRetries` / `treedxLeaseRetryDelayMs` | 15000 / 900 / 3 / 1000 | TreeDX transport tunables (fetch timeout, workspace TTL, lease retry count and delay) |
| `enrichmentEnabled` | true | **false makes the whole P2 ladder a pure no-op** — corpus stays fully working |
| `enrichmentModel` | `''` (conversation route) | the annotator override |
| `enrichmentIdleMs` / `enrichmentBatchCap` | 60000 / 5 | idle trigger; chapters per drain |
| `vocabApply` | false | shadow (default) vs git-visible topic curation |
| `vocabCoMin` / `vocabOverlapMin` | 3 / 0.5 | trust thresholds for emergent vocabulary |
| `coreRulesBudgetTokens` | 1200 | the CORE RULES block in notices — **refuses with numbers, never clips** |
| `rulesCoreBonus` | 0.15 | per-machine rank bonus for core-approved rules |
| `continuationBudgetRatio` | 0.25 | TOC + note share of the window *remaining after the header* |
| `chapterTokenTarget` / `chapterLimit` | 8000 / 8000 | soft per-chapter size / hard split |
| `mergeThreshold` | 0.3 | turn→chapter topic-merge τ (archive-time only) |
| `planInlineChars` | 900 | verbatim plan characters printed in a chapter's Plans block — the plan's **full** text is always an artifact, so this is display economy, never a data decision (`0` = pointer only) |
| `plansInNotice` | true | carry the plan block into a child's notice; renders **zero bytes** when the path holds no plan, so tape neutrality is the default |
| `planSeedMode` | true | seed `plan/mode {active:true}` into a **continuation** child when the archived span was still in plan mode, so the gate survives the boundary (measured: kernel accepts the two-event seed, the host's own projection folds it). Never for a branch, never after an approval — approving a plan exits plan mode |
| `plansInCheckpoint` | true | carry the operative plan into every in-place compaction checkpoint, the way the plot is carried — because shadowing can hide the chapter that holds it |
| `planCheckpointChars` | 1600 | how much plan text a checkpoint carries; the archive keeps all of it, and a truncated carry says so in the text |
| `retrievalHints` | true | put `## Finding things` in the child's notice — the three lookup verbs (`read`, `chapters_artifact`, `chapters_search`). Off ⇒ the notice is byte-identical to the pre-hint shape |
| `callArgArtifactTokens` | 0 (off) | above this, a tool-call *argument* is artifact-backed and the inline text is a bounded head. Off by default on purpose: switching it on changes chapter bytes wherever a `write` carried a whole file, which means your model tapes need re-recording |
| `toolResultDeferFloorTokens` | 200 | archive-time inline/defer floor (realm `toolResultArtifactTokens` is the *arrival* floor — keep it **above** your chunk size: below it, stubs hide compaction and thresholds silently stop firing — measured) |
| `artifactStoreRoot` | `.dsh-chapters` | workspace store (must be `read`-reachable) |
| `installChaptersPreset` | true | **inert since 0.1.18** — the preset is the `preset-chapters` row in the bundle patch; `disabled: true` on that row is the switch. Still accepted so an older profile patch parses |
| `compactionThresholdRatio` | 0.9 | **inert since 0.1.18** — it is `thresholdRatio` on the preset's `chapters-engine` row now (see [§17](/reference/configuration/) notes on the realm plane) |
| `fallbackPreset` | `chapters` | mounted for children when the caller's preset can't be resolved |
| `searchDefaultMaxTokens` | 400 | `chapters_search` result-packing budget |
