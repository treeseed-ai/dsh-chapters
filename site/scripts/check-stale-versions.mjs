/**
 * Stale-version guard — run by `npm run build` before Astro builds the site.
 *
 * Why this exists: an install instruction with a version typed into it is a
 * sentence that goes wrong the moment a release ships, and it actively tells a
 * reader to install an outdated plugin. The site's rule is therefore:
 *
 *   instructions a human runs  → `@latest` (cannot go stale)
 *   naming the current release → interpolated at build time from the repo's own
 *                                package.json (`src/data/plugin-version.mjs`)
 *   the changelog (§26)        → literal versions, forever: it is the record
 *
 * So a pinned `@treeseed/dsh-chapters@1.2.3` or a "latest is 1.2.3" anywhere
 * outside the changelog is a defect, and the build says so with the file and
 * line rather than shipping the lie. Patterns are narrow on purpose: a historical
 * attribution ("since 0.1.4 …") in a concepts or evidence page is a true record
 * of when something shipped, not an instruction, and stays legal.
